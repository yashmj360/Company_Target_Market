# For an e-learning company, finding best markets to advertise in:
We're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement.

## Goal:
Our goal is to find out two best markets to advertise ourselves, by using the provided csv file.

## Details:
To find the desired information, we have csv file named 2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv containing survey information from various source. The csv file is very detailed and contains various modes through which the data was collected. We will be using data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey.This survey was done in year 2017.

freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.

This data is available publicly on this github respository.

## Conclusion:
In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
